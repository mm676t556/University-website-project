                <p>My dear students… <br>

                  It is my pleasure to welcome you to the page of PUA’s Faculty of Pharmacy, wishing you continued

                  excellence. The Faculty of Pharmacy is among the leading accredited scientific institutions in the

                  NAQAAE
                  accreditation twice; one in 2016, and another in 2021.

                  Over the past years, the Faculty achieved a series of achievements in education, scientific research,
                  and
                  institutional development. All these achievements aimed to graduate distinguished and highly trained
                  pharmacists with
                  competitive ability to adapt to challenges of the local and regional environments in accordance with
                  the

                  of the modern pharmaceutical labor market. The Faculty also harnesses all its capabilities to prepare
                  its

                  clinical
                  courses, whereas the final year is for intensive clinical training in hospital wards and health care
                  centers.

                  The Faculty of Pharmacy is committed to the PUA’s vision, mission, and strategic goals to achieve
                  Egypt’s

                  distinguished
                  academic guidance, and establishes eminent research centers. The Faculty is keen to collaborate with
                  external
                  cooperation and exchange knowledge with various training providers to provide the best training
                  opportunities
                  for
                  students.

                  May God grant you success in all your future endeavors.</p>

                the registration
                process instead. This takes place at the beginning of every semester after the academic advisor meets
